# NBA.matches

I made this package to help evaluate the skill sets of nba players and put it into simple terms.
the goal of this package is to take stats and compare them against thersholds to allow users to see where players rank against the current nba
it may be used for past seasons, but the stats will be compared against numbers from the 23/24 season

it should be noted that prior eras of basketball may not apply as well, since blocks used to not be recorded and there wasn't always a three point line.
